## Launch an nginx container, available on Docker Hub, as a background task. It should be named overlord, be able to restart on its own, and have its 80 port attached to the 5000 port of Char. You can check that your container functions properly by visiting http://<ip-de-char>:5000 in your web browser.

docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name overlord --restart=always nginx

# To test, navigate to the following address in a web browser: <ip-of-char>:5000/
