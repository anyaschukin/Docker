## You will personalize this container so that you can use the Flask micro-framework in its latest version. You will make sure that an html page displaying "Hello World" with \<h1> tags can be served by Flask. You will test that your container is properly set up by accessing, via curl or a web browser, the IP address of your virtual machine on the 3000 port.
## You will also list all the necessary commands in your repository.

docker run --name Abathur -v ~/:/root -p 3000:3000 -itd python:2-slim
docker exec Abathur pip install Flask
echo 'from flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n@app.route("/")\ndef hello_world():\n\treturn "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"' > ~/app.py
docker exec --env FLASK_APP=/root/app.py Abathur flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port 3000

# To test, navigate to the following address in a web browser: {VM_IP}:3000
